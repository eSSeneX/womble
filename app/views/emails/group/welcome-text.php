Thanks for booking to come to Womble 2013


We’re dead chuffed that you’ve chosen to come to our event and were going to
do everything we can do to make it the best Womble ever.

We’ve booked your activities for you and will be in contact in the coming
months to ask you a few additional questions that will help the event run even
more smoothly, but if you have any questions please drop us an email and we’ll
pass it onto the team lead.

Now for the money side of things... Please send us a cheque for £20 per person
attending; including leaders and adults to us at: Womble 2013 bookings, County
Scout Centre, Winchester Road, Blaby, Leicestershire LE8 4H.  Cheques need to
be payable to "Leicestershire Scout Council" and if you can write on the back
the names of the people who you are paying for it makes it a lot easier for
us.  Deposits are non refundable.

We’ll then be asking for the remaining £25 later this year (mid May) along
with your health forms.

Finally if you have been to Womble before you’ll know that you need to be
building up your arm muscles, doing chin ups and increasing your flexibility
as much as you can do.


All the best,
Womble
